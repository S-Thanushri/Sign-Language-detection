# Sign-Language-detection

Training a classifier requires a dataset with hand sign images and corresponding labels. In this example, we'll use the popular American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet dataset, which contains images of each letter in the ASL alphabet.

You can download the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet

Replace 'path/to/your/dataset' with the path to the folder containing the ASL alphabet dataset. The program will load the images, preprocess them, train a Support Vector Machine classifier, and then save the trained classifier to 'classifier.pkl'.

To use the trained classifier to detect hand signs in real-time and display the corresponding meaning as text, you need to modify the previous hand sign detection program. In this modified version, we will load the trained classifier and map the predicted hand sign labels to their corresponding meanings.

In this code, we added a dictionary called label_to_meaning to map the predicted labels (hand signs) to their corresponding meanings. You should extend this dictionary to include all the hand signs your classifier can recognize, along with their meanings.

When you run this program, it will use the pre-trained classifier to predict the hand sign in real-time and display the corresponding meaning as text on the video stream. If the classifier predicts an unknown hand sign (not present in the label_to_meaning dictionary), it will display "Unknown" as the meaning.
